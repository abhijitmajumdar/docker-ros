# ROS over docker
- `docker-ros` is the main command to do everything
- alias `docker-ros` to use throughout system
- source `docker-ros-bash-completion` to enable autocomplete for any `docker-ros` command (press TAB TAB)
  - NOTE: to be able to use auto completion, you need to add the bash-completion package. Run `docker-ros add bash-completion`
- run `docker-ros` for help
